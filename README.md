# watering-system
Automated watering system using NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontrollers and Node.js server on Raspberry Pi

Sensors will be placed in multiple potted plants to measure water levels in the soil. NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontrollers will transmit the data from the sensors to the backend server, where it will be stored in a database. Our frontend web app will pull data from the backend and will display statistics over time as well as provide the option for a manual plant watering.
